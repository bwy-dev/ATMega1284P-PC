# A simple Personal Computer using the ATMega1284P

**Note**: this is currently a silly personal project and learning excercise, it may never be useful for another other than myself.

### Planned Features
 - Custom Keyboard interaction, with generic keyboard interaction down the line
 - VGA output
 - Command Line Interface
 - Word Processing
 - AVR assembler to write code to be executed by the device (one day, a man can dream)

### Basic Circuit Diagram
#### I will update this and add more detail as I go
